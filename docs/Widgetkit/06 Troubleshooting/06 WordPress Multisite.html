<h1 class="title">WordPress Multisite with Widgetkit 2</h1>

<h2>1. How do I install a Multisite with Widgetkit 2?</h2>
<p>
First you need to activate the Multisite in WordPress. To do that access your site's root via FTP and open the file <em>wp-config.php</em>.
Look for the line:</p>

	<pre><code>
		/* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */
	</code></pre>

<p>and add the following code <em>above</em> it:</p>

	<pre><code>
		define(&#39;WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE&#39;, true);
	</code></pre>

<p>Go back to your WordPress Dashboard and <em>deactivate</em> every plugin you have. 
Next go to _Tools -> Network Setup_ and follow the instructions.</p>

<p>For a complete instruction on how to install a Multisite please have a look at the official WordPress Codex: [Create a Multisite](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network)<br />

After you added the code snippets to your wp-config.php and .htaccess file, reload the page and log yourself back in. 
Now you installed the Multisite. Create a new Site by going to <em>Sites -> Add new_</em>.<br />

To activate Widgetkit on your Sites you <em>can not</em> use the Network Activate Bulk Action. Widgetkit need its own database within the Multisites so you have to activate Widgetkit on every site by itself.</p>

<p>Go to <em>every Site</em> you installed and activate Widgetkit. </p>

<p>And there you have it. Now you can create Widgets with Widgetkit on every Multisite. </p>


<h2>2. When I click on Widgetkit in my Multisite I get the Message 'Insufficient User Rights', why?</h2>
<p>If you get the Error Message you activated Widgetkit in your Network Admin via the Bulk Option <em>Network Activate</em> which does not work with Widgetkit. 
Deactivate Widgetkit in your Network Admin and go to your Multisite. Click on Plugins and activate Widgetkit right there for every site.</p>


<h2>3. The Widgets I created with Widgetkit won't save, why?</h2>
<p>This could also happen if you activated Widgetkit as the Network Admin. Deactivate Widgetkit and go to every Multisite you created to activate Widgetkit one by one.</p>
