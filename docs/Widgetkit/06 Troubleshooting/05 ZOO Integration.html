<h1 class="title">ZOO Integration</h1>

<p>Widgetkit allows you to use content types right from ZOO. In order for Widgetkit to know which elements of your ZOO types should be used, you have to set up a custom mapping. This gives you full control of how your content is presented.</p>

<h2>How to use ZOO content in Widgetkit 2</h2>

<p>Like with any other widget content, we first navigate to an article or module in Joomla and click on the <em>Widgetkit</em> button in the editor. Select any Widget type you like. Once you are presented with the selection of content, you can create a new content item with content coming from ZOO.</p>

<p>Select ZOO from the <em>Select Content Type</em> field.</p>

<p>Select your desired App and the type of content you want to display. In our example we are choosing the Business directory App from the demo content and the <em>Company</em> type.</p>

<p>Select all options as you desire and confirm with a click on the <em>Save</em> button. Close the content editor to go back to the Widget configuration. Hit <em>Save</em> and close the Widgetkit interface.</p>

<p>Save your article or module and navigate to the frontend to view your widget. Right now, you will not be seeing any output or just a broken view. To change this we have to map ZOO elemets to the content fields that Widgetkit understands.</p>

<h2>Map ZOO content elements to Widgetkit 2</h2>

<p>Any type in ZOO can have arbitrary elements with basically unlimited combinations. Widgetkit on the other hand uses content providers with a limited set of fields that are used for rendering. That is why we have to assign a mapping from ZOO elements to the content fields Widgetkit knows about.</p>

<p>Widgekit includes a default mapping for ZOO apps. If you want to change that mapping, please have a look at {doc: field-mapping text:Field Mappings}.</p>
