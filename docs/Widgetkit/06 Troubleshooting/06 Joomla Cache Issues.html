<h1 class="title">Joomla! Cache Issues</h1>

<p>Widgetkit 2 is not compatible with Joomla! Progressive Cache because in such environment some necessary events are not getting triggered. If your project requires the Caching feature there is a workaround with a custom script.</p>

<p>Place the following code in your Theme custom PHP script file or withing a custom system plugin:</p>

<code>
    if ($app = @include JPATH_ADMINISTRATOR.'/components/com_widgetkit/widgetkit-app.php') {
        $app-&gt;trigger('view', array($app));
    }
</code>
