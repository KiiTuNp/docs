<h1 class="title">Widget Plugins</h1>

<p>
    A widget plugin determines how your widget will be displayed in the frontend, for example as a Slideshow or a Grid. You can also add custom widget plugins. Each plugin accepts a set of configuration parameters. These can be set using the visual interface provided by Widgetkit or by changing the shortcode directly.
</p>

<h2>Accordion</h2>

<p>
    The Accordion widget display content inside a list of items that can be expanded and collapsed by clicking each of their headers.
</p>

<table class="zebra">
    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Section</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Accordion</td>
            <td>Determine whether or not multiple items can be opened at the same time.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Media</td>
            <td>Determine, if and how media and overlay of all items are rendered. You can apply different animations to the overlay and the images.<br>
            <span class="badge">NOTE</span> The link as well as the <em>Social Buttons</em> can be added in the {doc:content-manager text:Content Manager} and through {doc:manage-fields text:Custom fields} when creating the content.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Content</td>
            <td>Determine, if and how the content of all items is rendered.<br>

            <td>Set a custom HTML class that will be added to the widget element in the rendered output.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Example Shortcode</h3>

<p>This is a default Accordion widget. An open item will collapse automatically when another one expands.</p>

<pre><code>[widgetkit id="23" widget="accordion"]</code></pre>

<p>An accordion widget that allows multiple opened items and links the media overlay to the URL you have set in the {doc:content-manager text:Content Manager}.</p>

<pre><code>[widgetkit id="23" widget="accordion" collapse=0 media_overlay="link"]</code></pre>

<h2>Gallery</h2>

<p>
    The gallery widget displays images and videos in a grid, automatically creating thumbnails for your media items. Use the widget configuration to change the appearance of the gallery.
</p>

<table class="zebra">
    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Section</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Layout</td>
            <td>Configure the behavior of the gallery grid, the number of columns for different screen sizes (for responsive behaviour) and add animations to the gallery items.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Media</td>
            <td>Determine, if and how media and overlay of all items are rendered. You can apply different animations to the overlay and the images.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Content</td>
            <td>Determine, if and how the content of all items is rendered.<br>
            <span class="badge">NOTE</span> The link as well as the <em>Social Buttons</em> can be added in the {doc:content-manager text:Content Manager} and through {doc:manage-fields text:Custom fields} when creating the content.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Lightbox</td>
            <td>Enable a lighbox to display your media fully sized or set a fixed width and height. You can use the title or the content field as a text caption.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>General</td>
            <td>Set a custom HTML class that will be added to the widget element in the rendered output.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Example Shortcode</h3>

<p>Default gallery widget. Content items will have 100% each and will therefore be stacked. The content is displayed in an image caption and the overlay content is an icon.</p>

<pre><code>[widgetkit id="23" widget="gallery"]</code></pre>

<p>A gallery widget that displays 4 columns on large screens automatically collapses to 2 columns on tablets and such and displays a single column on all devices smaller than that. To understand this mobile first approach, have a look at the <a href="http://getuikit.com/docs/grid.html#responsive-width">UIkit responsive grid</a> that is used here. The overlay is centered and title, content as well as the lightbox link, which are displayed as small icon, are located inside the overlay.</p>

<pre><code>[widgetkit id="23" widget="gallery" columns_medium="2" columns_large="4" overlay="center" lightbox_link=1 lightbox_style="icon-small"]</code></pre>

<h2>Grid</h2>

<p>
    In a Grid widget, all items will be displayed as single items of a grid. The height of grid items can be matched or displayed in a dynamic grid, always applying the same spacing between items regardless of their height.
</p>

<table class="zebra">
    <thead>

            <td>Layout</td>
            <td>Configure the behavior of the grid, number of columns for different screen sizes (for responsive behaviour) and set the panel appearance.

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Media</td>

<h2>Grid Slider</h2>

<p>
    A Grid Slider widget allows you to display multiple Slideshows within one grid. Mind that when creating content for this widget, you need to add another media field for every slide your slideshow is going to have. Each slide will be displayed with the same content and title field within one item.

<h2>Grid Stack</h2>

<p>
    In a Grid stack, all items from your selected content will be rendered below each other. This can easily be used for a paired display of an image (taken from the media field of your content item) and a short text (taken from the content field of your content item).

<h2>Map</h2>

<p>
    A map widget displays a Google map on your website. Make sure to add a custom field <em>Location</em> to your content element and select a location you want to display in the map. The other fields of your content will be displayed when you click on the location marker (provided the Popup is enabled). You can add several pins and popup boxes by adding more items to your content element. For more information, read the {doc:manage-fields text:Manage fields} doc.

<h2>Slideshow</h2>

<p>
    A slideshow turns your selected content element into a sequence of slides. Each item in your content element will represent one slide. Select a media element as the slide's background. The title and content fields can be displayed in an overlay on top of that image.

<h2>Switcher</h2>

<p>
    A switcher consists of a number of navigation toggles and their related content items. Switchers are useful for realizing little tabbed navigations and similar. Each item in your selected content element will result in a navigation entry.
