<h1 class="title">Widget Plugins</h1>

<p>
    A widget plugin determines how your widget will be displayed in the frontend, for example as a Slideshow or a Grid. You can also add custom widget plugins. Each plugin accepts a set of configuration parameters. These can be set in the <em>Settings</em> panel of the Widget Manager.
</p>

<h2>Accordion</h2>

<p>
    The Accordion widget displays content inside a list of items that can be expanded and collapsed by clicking each of their headers.
</p>

<table class="zebra">
    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Section</th>
          <th>Description</th>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Gallery</h2>

<p>
    The gallery widget displays images and videos in a grid, automatically creating thumbnails for your media items. Use the widget configuration to change the appearance of the gallery.
</p>

<table class="zebra">
    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Section</th>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Grid</h2>

<p>
    In a Grid widget, all items will be displayed as single items of a grid. The height of grid items can be matched or displayed in a dynamic grid, always applying the same spacing between items regardless of their height.
</p>

<table class="zebra">
    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Section</th>
          <th>Description</th>

            <td>Configure the behavior of the grid, number of columns for different screen sizes (for responsive behaviour) and set the panel appearance.

        </tr>
    </tbody>

<h2>Grid Slider</h2>

<p>
    A Grid Slider widget allows you to display multiple Slideshows within one grid. Mind that when creating content for this widget, you need to add another media field for every slide your slideshow is going to have. Each slide will be displayed with the same content and title field within one item.
</p>

<table class="zebra">
    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Section</th>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Grid Stack</h2>

<p>
    In a Grid stack, all items from your selected content will be rendered below each other. This can easily be used for a paired display of an image (taken from the media field of your content item) and a short text (taken from the content field of your content item).
</p>

<table class="zebra">
    <thead>

<h2>Map</h2>

<p>
    A map widget displays a Google map on your website. Make sure to add a custom field <em>Location</em> to your content element and select a location you want to display in the map. The other fields of your content will be displayed when you click on the location marker (provided the Popup is enabled). You can add several pins and popup boxes by adding more items to your content element. For more information, read the {doc:custom-fields text:Manage fields} doc.

<h2>Slideshow</h2>

<p>
    A slideshow turns your selected content element into a sequence of slides. Each item in your content element will represent one slide. Select a media element as the slide's background. The title and content fields can be displayed in an overlay on top of that image.
</p>

<table class="zebra">

<h2>Switcher</h2>

<p>
    A switcher consists of a number of navigation toggles and their related content items. Switchers are useful for realizing little tabbed navigations and similar. Each item in your selected content element will result in a navigation entry.
