<h1 class="title">How To Solve ZOO Issues</h1>

<p>If you are having trouble or issues with ZOO, this can have numerous causes. ZOO has a build in system check, to detect some of the problems. But there are some commen issues that might arise:</p>


<h2>Faulty interface actions - Javascript Errors</h2>

<p>If you are having trouble with functions in ZOO, this might be due to a jQuery conflict. Please read {doc: javascript-errors text: this tutorial} on how to detect and resolve the problem.</p>

<h2>Unstyled content - no CSS being loaded</h2>

<p>This might be due to file permission issues. Please read {doc: file-permission-issues-3 text: this tutorial} on how to detect and resolve the problem.</p>

<h2 id="blank-page">Blank Page</h2>

<p>This is most likely due to a php error being thrown. Please enable the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.display-errors">display_errors parameter</a> in your php.ini. Only with an error message the problem can be found.</p>

<p>Another way to check for PHP errors, is to have a look at your PHP error log. The PHP log shows information on errors and warnings thrown by PHP. Your host should have configured PHP to write that information to a log rather than output them on screen.</p>
