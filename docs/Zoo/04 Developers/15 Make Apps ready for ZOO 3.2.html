<p>This tutorial will walk you through the process of making your custom app ready for ZOO 3.2.</p>

<p>There are only three steps needed to accomplish this task:</p>

<ul class="bullet">
    <li>Create an 'edit' layout for your app. To do so just follow the steps described {doc: create-a-new-layout-with-positions text: here} or take a look at ZOO standard apps.</li>
    <li>Assign elements to your new 'edit' layout.</li>
    <li>{doc: assign-elements-to-layout-positions text: Assign the <em>Item Edit</em> element to a layout of your choice}.</li>
</ul>

<p>To enable comment frontend editing for your app just follow these steps:<p>
<p>If a template of your custom app overrides 'comments.php' you need to adjust 'comments.php' and copy '_edit.php'. You can simply copy these files from one of ZOO standard apps.</p>
