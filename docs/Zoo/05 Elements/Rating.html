<h1 class="title">Rating Element</h1>

<p>In this tutorial you learn how to configure a rating element with its specific values to use it in ZOO.</p>

<p>How you create an element like this, we show you in {doc: create-new-types text: this tutorial}.</p>


<h2>1. Configuration</h2>

<div class="clearfix">
	<img class="align-right margin-t-10" src="../../../assets/images/zoo/element_rating.png" alt="Parameter settings" title="Parameter settings" width="390" height="157" />

	<p>Here is the description of the different values:</p>

	<p>Name: Type in the name for this element which will be used later on, for example in the item creation view or as label in the frontend. With the name you also can identify the element, when you assign it to a template position.</p>

	<p>Description: The description will show up as a tooltip in the item creation view</p>

	<p>Stars: Choose the total of stars which can be used by the visitors to rate this item.</p>

	<p>Alow vote for: You can restrict the rating to following permission groups: public, registered and special.</p>
</div>


<h2>2. Element Assignment</h2>

<div class="clearfix">
	<img class="align-right margin-t-10" src="../../../assets/images/zoo/element_rating_2.png" alt="Parameter settings" title="Parameter settings" width="390" height="163" />

	<p>Every element has to be assigned to a template position to show up for the visitors in the frontend of the site. See {doc: assign-elements-to-layout-positions text: this tutorial} how to assign elements to the template positions.</p>

	<p>You can set whether the label is shown in the frontend or not. If you choose <em>Yes</em> the name of the element (see previous step) is used for it. If you do not want to use the elements name as label you can type in an alternative. Of course the <em>Show Label</em> option have to be enabled to show the alternative label.</p>

	<p>With the Show Message option you can enable and disable the rating and you can choose whether the average rating and the total number of votes are shown underneath the rating stars.</p>
</div>


<h2>3. Item Creation</h2>

<div class="clearfix">

	<img class="align-right margin-t-10" src="../../../assets/images/zoo/element_rating_3.png" alt="Parameter settings" title="Parameter settings" width="390" height="88" />

	<p>This is how the element looks when you create an item. See {doc: create-and-manage-items text: this tutorial} for creating an item. You can see the average rating and how many users voted. After the first vote, a reset button appears. Click on it and the rating and the total number of votes will be reseted.</p>
