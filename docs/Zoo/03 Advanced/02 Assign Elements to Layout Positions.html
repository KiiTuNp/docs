<h1 class="title">Assign elements to layout positions</h1>

<p>Learn how to assign elements of a type to a layout position in your template. We explain the layouts for the different views and how you show the elements in the frontend of your site.</p>

<p>For creating an item type with the elements, please see {doc: create-new-types text: this tutorial}</p>


<h2>Choosing the layout</h2>

<p>You have to choose, which of the elements you want to show on which view in the frontend. For example, you can show all elements of an item on the <em>item view</em> (full layout is used) and if you like you can show only some of them in the in the <em>category view</em> (teaser layout is used).</p>

<p>Here is a description where the different layouts are used.</p>

<ol class="bold">
	<li><strong>Feed layout</strong>: It is used in the feed view. Assign elements to this feed layout, to show them in the feeds.</li>
	<li><strong>Full layout</strong>: It is used in the item view. Assign the elements to the full layout, to show them on the detail page of an item.</li>
	<li><strong>Related layout</strong>: It is used by the related item element. Assign the elements to the related layout to show elements of one item in another.</li>
	<li><strong>Teaser layout</strong>: It is used in the category view. Assign the elements to the teaser layout, to show them on the frontpage, categories, alpha index or tag page.</li>
	<li><strong>Item Module</strong>: Shows all layouts of the {doc: set-up-zoo-item-module text: ZOO Item Module}. Currently the default layout is used by most themes of the Item Module. Assign elements to this layout to show them in the Item Module.</li>
	<li><strong>Search Plugin</strong>: Shows all layouts of the {doc: set-up-zoo-tag-module text:ZOO Search Plugin}. Assign elements to the default layout to show them in the search results.</li>
</ol>

<div class="box-info">Please note, that the layouts of the different templates and apps may vary, so here are the most common ones, which are available in most apps.</div>

<p>Each of the above mentioned layouts have different predefined positions. If you want to edit the positions of a specific layout or if you want to create a new layout, follow {doc: create-a-new-template text: this tutorial}.</p>


<h2>Assigning the elements</h2>

<p>Click on the specific layout (see first part of this tutorial for a description) to assign the elements to it.</p>

<img src="../../../assets/images/zoo/create_type_5_5.png" alt="Create a new type" width="687" height="209" />

<p>Now on the left hand side you see all available layout positions. If you are editing a predefined item type of ZOO there are already elements assigned. If you've created a new item type the left site is empty.<p>

<p>On the right side you see all elements of the type (see {doc: create-new-types text: this tutorial} on creating a new item type). On the top you see the core elements which are available for every type and underneath it the custom elements which you have assigned to the type.</p>

<p>To assign the elements to the layout positions, simply click on the little brick icon next to the element name and Drag &amp; Drop it to its new position.</p>

<p>Each element you drag to a position will be automatically opened to configure it on this position. Check out our tutorials for each element to see all settings for the elements.</p>

<p>After clicking <em>Save</em> the elements will be shown to the visitors of your site in the frontend of ZOO.</p>

<div class="box-info">Of course you can assign elements of the item type to multiple layouts to show them in different views.</div>
