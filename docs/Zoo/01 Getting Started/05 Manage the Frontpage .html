	<p>First you can type in a short description, which will appear on the frontpage. It depends on the editor settings of your Joomla installation what Joomla editor will be used.</p>

	<p>On the right side under <em>Content</em>, you can type in a title, put an image to the frontpage and select title headlines for the categories and items, which are shown on the frontpage.</p>
	<p>When you click on <em>Select Image</em>, a lightbox will appear. Here you can either select an image of the folder <em>/images/stories</em> or you can click on <em>Browse</em> at the bottom of the lightbox to select an image for uploading it into your Joomla installation. After choosing a proper image, click on <em>Insert</em> in the top right corner of the lightbox.</p>

	<p>When you click on <em>Select Image</em>, a lightbox will appear. Here you can either select an image of the folder <em>/images/stories</em> or you can click on <em>Browse</em> at the bottom of the lightbox to select an image for uploading it into your Joomla installation. After choosing a proper image, click on <em>Insert</em> in the top right corner of the lightbox.</p>
</div>

<div class="box-hint">If the image does not have the right dimensions, you can put new values for width and height of the image into the according fields after closing the lightbox.</div>

	<p>In the next two tabs <em>Config</em> and <em>Template</em> you can set individual properties overriding the global settings of the app instance configuration. To do so, just uncheck the box before the property and new options like radio buttons or dropdown fields will appear. Here you can choose your favourite settings for the frontpage. In our example the latest created item will show on top of the other ones and the frontpage will show the categories in two columns.</p>

	<p>Go through the settings and change them to suit your needs.</p>
	
	<p>After finishing, click on <em>Save</em> in the top right corner of the screen.</p>
