<h1 class="title">How to install another language</h1>

<p>This tutorial will show you how toinstall a language pack for ZOO.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>Download the latest {route: download-zoo text: language packs}. The languages in the archive are sorted into folders. For example the English language can be found in <em>/en-GB</em>, the German language can be found in <em>/de-DE</em>. Choose the language you wish to install.</p>

<p>There are two different folders in the language folder, the applications folder <em>/apps</em> and ZOO component folder <em>/zoo</em>.</p>


<h2>Installing the language</h2>


<h3>Installing the application language files</h3>

<p>First we'll install the applications languages.</p>

<p>Simply copy the content of the <em>/apps</em> folder into <em>/media/zoo/applications/</em> That's it!</p>


<h3>Installing ZOO language files</h3>

<p>As with every Joomla component, there are frontend and backend language files. Simply copy the content of the <em>/zoo</em> folder to your Joomla installation. Again, that's it!</p>
